# A-Star-Pathfinding-Algorithm
 Implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm in python using pygame to build the GUI and interface.
 Instructions for use: run main to open the GUI window and begin the simulation and select blocks within the grid for the start point, end point, and walls. Before selecting blocks with your cursor, press 'a' to set it as the start point, 's' to set it as the end point, or 'd' to set it the block as a wall. After setting these as desired, click the space bar to run the simulation and A-star algorithm, and visualize how it works!
